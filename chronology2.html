      <ul>
        <li>The party arrives at the City of Crossroads, where all roads converge. Finally at the center of the
          continent, they are struck by how starkly different the city is compared to the Hartshorn Desert.</li>
        <li>Disembarking at the Qilin docks closest to the mouth of the river coming from Morgin’s Pass, the party parts
          ways with the roguish cook, Skewart, and Elaine, who bid goodbye to Xander with a smile.</li>
        <li>As they emerge onto the streets, a town crier sells them a page of the Qilin Corner, which they dig into to
          hopefully get the lay of the land. In it, they read of:
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>The violent tensions between the Wildflower territories, Edelweiss and Broomsedge</li>
          <li>The Qilin House of Culture</li>
          <li>The presence of a Sardior Range delegation for the conferences happening in the next few weeks</li>
          <li>The problems surrounding the Corco territory</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Syn joins the Crossroads fishing guild, starting off as a novice angler, but quickly proving his worth to
          his seasoned peers by reeling in quite a few catches in a row.</li>
        <li>The party reconvenes on the main streets of Qilin, discovering the Watering Hole, a popular tavern among the
          locals. They quickly book room and board, and after getting a taste of the local brew, the Melting Pot, Xander
          and Endhal try to get acquainted with the seedier folk in the tavern, hoping to quickly get a criminal
          contact.</li>
        <li>Going to an upper floor in the Watering Hole, the two come across a gang of criminal-adjacent drinkers. At
          the center of the group is a charismatic dwarven woman bearing the tattoos common of swamp natives. The two
          approach her, addressing her in Thieves’ Cant. In an instant, her intimidating demeanor folds, and she starts
          flirting with them in common. Endhal and Xander quickly realise that this woman, <strong>Geldine</strong>, is very, very
          attracted to elves.</li>
        <li>Retreating after a brief introduction, Endhal and Xander come back to the party, and after a harrowing
          explanation, the party retires for the night.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="date-section no-title">
      <ul>
        <li>That night, Xander is restless and struggles to meditate. The memory of being saved by his brother from
          disintegration is still fresh in his mind, and he knows that he must be close by.</li>
        <li>In the early hours of the morning, Xander goes back downstairs towards the main bar, and as he descends the
          last flight of stairs, he sees his beloved brother, <strong>Zirelios</strong>, sitting at the bar and discussing something with
          the owner.</li>
        <li>After a vigorous hug, Zirelios asks the barkeep for some privacy. The man nods and taps on a back wall
          nearby, opening up a secret meeting room where the two brothers and the party members could gather to discuss
          some things on the down low.</li>
        <li>After a few hours, Cadenza wakes and joins the rest of the party for breakfast in the meeting room. Once
          everyone is there, Zirelios explains how he came to be in Al Ahzoth, and gives everyone an abbreviated version
          of how he rose back to infamy as an informant in the last two years, as well as his rivalry with the White
          Dragon of the Sardior Range.</li>
        <li>Anxious, Xander then asks his brother about his death prior to their arrival in Al Ahzoth, a topic which
          Zirelios dodges for the time being, saying it would spoil a nice day. Instead, he gives everyone an address
          and proposes that everyone goes out to explore and then reconvene there in the evening.</li>
        <li>Before parting ways, Zirelios answers a few inquiries, telling Cadenza that her acquaintance, <strong>Solara
          Sibelius</strong> is currently employed by the Qilin House of Culture.</li>
        <li>That day, as Cadenza departs for the House of Culture and Xander and Iszyre join Zirelios on some errands,
          Syn continues fishing and Endhal continues exploring Qilin.</li>
        <li>On the side of the brothers and Iszyre, Zirelios shows them the merchant streets of Qilin, before taking
          them onto a boat, speaking more about each part of the city in greater detail. Eventually, the boat docks in
          Ecrin, which Zirelios describes as a residential territory where folks living here can preach and pray to
          whatever they like in complete freedom, decreed by the Crossroads City Hall.</li>
        <li>The three find a clearing, and Zirelios proposes a spar to his brother to gauge how far Xander is from his
          prime after everything that happened. The battle that follows is very one-sided. Iszyre joins in for a round
          of his own, but also falls to Zirelios’ skills.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, Cadenza sneaks into the classroom wing of the House of Culture, and eventually spots Solara
          teaching a class. Despite wanting to sneak back out unnoticed, Cadenza is spotted by her friend’s sharp eye,
          and they have a touching reunion. Cadenza decides to bring Solara back to the address given by Zirelios, and
          her friend happily agrees.</li>
        <li>In the evening, everyone reconvenes at the address in the lower parts of Qilin. The place turns out to be a
          cozy abode equipped with several rooms. Zirelios arrives with Xander and Iszyre, each with several bags of
          meat and produce in hand. Inviting everyone, Zirelios introduces the group to his old base of operations, and
          offers the group to stay here as a gift for putting up with Xander for the past few weeks. He also gives
          everyone some gold leftover from his heist on the White Dragon’s hoard, saying that they probably need it more
          than he does at this time.</li>
        <li>That night, Zirelios fulfills his promise of coming clean about Xander’s passing. He tries to give the party
          a ‘kinder’ version of the events, hoping no one would notice. Cadenza detects that he is omitting some
          details, and under her watchful eye, Zirelios recounts exactly how Xander turned his blade on himself.</li>
        <li>With a heavy heart, Zirelios bids everyone goodnight, but Cadenza catches him right outside the building,
          asking him one last question about an individual named “<strong>Dorissa Ama’ati</strong>”. After thinking on it and ruffling
          through his personal notes, Zirelios remembers that he is to meet with someone of that name in a few weeks,
          around the time of the major conferences that would happen in the city. Cadenza asks whether he would let her
          spy on the meeting, and he agrees.</li>
        <li>Before retiring for the night, the group spend some time with Xander to make sure he is doing alright, and
          Cadenza accompanies Solara back home.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="date-section no-title">
      <ul>
        <li>The following day, the party is back on the town. At the behest of Endhal, they visit the Qilin Magic
          Emporium, where they purchase some scrolls from the bargain bin. The party is once again reminded of Endhal’s
          fascination with the arcane arts.</li>
        <li>In order to gather some more information about their mark, the Harlequin, Endhal and Xander return to
          Geldine and are subjected to another round of flirting, which they awkwardly endure. For some reason, the two
          elves don’t think to shut her down completely, which she takes as an invitation to continue.</li>
        <li>After some very long minutes, the topic turns to the Harlequin. Geldine directs them towards the Coals, the
          slums of Qilin. She also tells them that the best way to track down a maniac is not by the guards, nor by
          sniffing around, but by cornering their most dedicated fans, as they would already have done the work for you.
        </li>
        <li>After some preparations, the party visits the slums that evening, and once they spot a likely suspect,
          Cadenza adopts the guise of a fellow fan, and approaches. She sells the disguise extremely well, and the
          crazed fan shares all he knows about the when and where the Harlequin is likely to appear.</li>
        <li>The next day, the party decides to investigate the happenings around the Corco Estate, now understanding
          that there is more or less an open contract for capable adventurers to come and exterminate the rampaging
          beasts and monsters around their territory.</li>
        <li>Once there, they are ushered into the guard barracks and informed about payment. They are then asked to
          report to <strong>Master Horus</strong> for inspection around the cliffs before they take the lift down. Master Horus is a
          great shoebill of undeniable presence, and he evaluates the party members one by one. He approves of everyone,
          but especially dislikes Endhal for some reason.</li>
        <li>The party clears out some creatures and some displacer beasts in the woods around the Corco perimeter before
          calling it a day. After receiving payment, they go to leave the estate, when a high elf in full armor calls
          out to Endhal, introducing himself as <strong>Halafarin</strong>, and that he is pleased to see a “brother” still well and
          safe.</li>
        <li>Following that, they continue exploring the city, this time moving towards Tiamat’s Landing to get the lay
          of the land. Once there, they are awed by the grandiose architecture, and see that the majority of residents
          are dragonborn of either gold or blue bloodlines. Endhal doesn’t join the party, instead opting to check out
          Edelweiss and get his thoughts in order.</li>
        <li>The party members visiting Tiamat’s Landing briefly learn about the declining <strong>Kai family</strong> and the rising
          power of the <strong>Lu family</strong> within the Sardior Range by listening in to an argument on the streets.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, Endhal makes the acquaintance of <strong>Omar</strong>, a middle-aged fisherman, boatsman and family man who is
          quick to tell Endhal he reminds him of his son. Not equipped to deal with such a talkative person, Endhal
          deeply wishes for the boat ride to be over soon.</li>
        <li>Arriving in Edelweiss, Endhal takes some time to gather some ingredients and then starts to look around,
          noticing some strange stone monuments dispersed throughout. As he walks into a peaceful inner village, he is
          hollered to a hole-in-the-wall tavern where the owner boasts her brew is the best in this part of the world.
        </li>
        <li>After a heated debate with himself, Endhal lets himself be convinced to have one drink. As he sips the
          admittedly good ale, he is joined by a jolly gnome wearing a beret. He introduces himself as <strong>Sharpshank</strong>, and
          proudly starts talking about Edelweiss. Unable to stop him, Endhal is dragged through another half-dozen
          pints.</li>
        <li>That night, Endhal arrives at the abode one step away from being blackout drunk. Before he passes out, the
          others inquire as to how he got like this, and Endhal blames Sharphank for his misfortune. The others
          eventually realize that Sharpshank is a key figure mentioned in the Qilin Corner page they had read on the day
          of their arrival.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="date-section no-title">
      <ul>
        <li>The next day, the party gears up and departs for Edelweiss, aiming to get some more answers out of
          Sharpshank now that they have a connection in the form of Endhal. Once there, the search is largely fruitless,
          but in a moment of insight (Nat20), Endhal spots the man and a few other gnomes taking a large draped object
          from a nearby workshop and hoisting it on their shoulders.</li>
        <li>The party approaches Sharphsank and upon spotting them, he asks his pals to give them some privacy and takes
          them aside. Greeting Endhal and grinning at the visible remnants of his hangover, Sharpshank introduces
          himself, and proposes that they take the chat elsewhere, given that someone helps him carry the draped object.
        </li>
        <li>Agreeing, the party goes along with Sharpshank to a clearing some ways away from the center of Edelweiss, at
          the foot of a large tree. Once there, Sharpshank reveals a large hole which feels both holy and unholy, and
          uncovering the draped object as one of the many stone menhirs around his lands. The party helps him plug the
          hole, after which he reveals many things about Al Ahzoth.</li>

        <ol>
          <li>He reveals he could sense that most of the party is not from Al Ahzoth.</li>
          <li>He asks the party if they know of the Lost God, or if they had noticed a general absence of godly worship
            during their time on the continent. After getting his answer, he reveals the Lost God is the only true,
            sanctified deity in Al Ahzoth, and that the name of the continent translates to “The Cadaver”.</li>
          <li>He reveals that the continent is made from this god’s flesh, and that the land has been rotting since its
            creation long ago.</li>
          <li>When asked about his role in all of this, he calls himself the [Anchor] of Edelweiss, and that he, just
            like many others like him around the continent, is the direct link grafting Edelweiss to the Cadaver. He
            lifts up his shirt and reveals numerous wounds, showing that his body is a microcosm of his lands, and that
            should he die, his lands would follow. He also mentions that the opposite is true: that if Edelweiss and its
            people were to be destroyed beyond salvage, it would drive him to death’s door.</li>
          <li>When asked about the looming conflict between Edelweiss and Broomsedge, Sharpshank asks Xander what he
            knows of divinity and domains. He explains that since the Lost God’s primary domains were of Hegemony and
            Conquest, the ones grafted to its corpse are bound by the same rules. In short, all anchors live by the laws
            of hegemony and can only delay the urge for so long.</li>
          <li>When asked about Tiresius Vinea and his role in all of this, Sharpshank refers to him as the janitor, or
            the reaper who would come to ensure the conquered are disposed of.</li>
        </ol>

        <li>During the conversation with Sharpshank, Iszyre asks about the large hole in his old laboratory which was
          described in Gregor’s journal. Sharpshank answers that there must be a terrible wound that opened up on the
          Anchor’s body when that hole was created. From then on, Iszyre seems to recall something, and is near
          catatonic.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="date-section no-title">
      <ul>
        <li>Once the conversation wraps up, Sharpshank bids the party goodbye, and returns to other tasks. The party
          goes back to the riverside and gestures for two boats to get them back to Qilin. Cadenza and Xander take the
          first, and Iszyre, Endhal and Syn get on the second.</li>
        <li>During the boat ride, Iszyre suddenly stands up, eyes wide, before fainting and falling overboard. Endhal
          and Syn are quick to react, with the latter jumping overboard into the river. Iszyre sinks as if pulled by an
          invisible force and Syn struggles to catch up. It is then that Syn’s mouth forcibly moves as his very druidic
          patron speaks through his mouth, mocking him once more. From under Iszyre, a giant fox’s gaping maw, larger
          than any shark, appears ready to swallow him.</li>
        <li>Back above water, Xander hears the splashes and makes their boat turn around, poised to help. Syn struggles
          underwater, trying to regain control over his body as he swallows heapfuls of water. Finally regaining
          control, he snatches Iszyre from the scalding jaws and pulls him back to the boat, where Syn is able to grasp
          Endhal’s hand.</li>
        <li>While this is happening, a wandering bard named <strong>Yarros</strong> is kicked out of a high-end music establishment due
          to smelling of swamp and sweat. Having just arrived in town after a terrible journey through the Chthonian
          Wetlands, he has naught but a few coins to his name, and his clothes are filthy. His metallic limbs complete
          the look.</li>
        <li>Sad and weary, Yarros finds a nearby tavern and drowns his sorrows in drink with the few coins he has left.
          The barkeep takes pity on him through the evening and pays off a portion of his tab. Yarros would only wander
          off towards the Coals later that night.</li>
        <li>Back to shore after a harrowing experience, the group drags Iszyre back to their abode and somberly ponder
          the day’s events. Before going out and confronting the Harlequin in Qilin’s Coals, Syn goes shopping and
          Cadenza checks in on Solara just to be sure.</li>
        <li>Hours later, as day turns to night, the party gets ready to hunt. However, as they are about to depart,
          Zirelios wanders in and asks them what’s wrong with their eldest member; Iszyre has run off on his own.
          Zirelios points in a direction and after a sincere conversation with Xander about making sure he’s ready to
          go, he says he’ll be back the following morning.</li>
        <li>Separating into two groups, the party is soon on their way. Xander and Syn try to find Iszyre while Cadenza
          and Endhal sneak towards the Coals towards the street corner the crazed fan had pointed them to.</li>
        <li>Quickly deciding on Crossroads Station as Iszyre’s most likely destination, Syn and Xander corner him before
          he boards the last train. He says that there is something that only he can alone can do, but that he would be
          back soon.</li>
        <li>In the Coals, Cadenza and Endhal quickly take point, with Cadenza on a nearby rooftop and Endhal hiding in
          an alley behind some crates. They see the fan Cadenza had talked to the other day hiding in another alleyway,
          but leave him be. Soon, they start to hear some jingling bells in the distance.</li>
        <li>As this is happening, a very drunk Yarros is smashing through a garbage can in a nearby alleyway. He takes a
          few seconds to get back up and wanders into an open street as the Harlequin is appearing some ways away. He
          becomes a prime target for the killer, who quickly approaches.</li>
        <li>With a ring of the bells, Endhal and Yarros are blinded and are made to deal with the debilitated threat.
          Before Syn and Xander can even get there, Endhal almost dies, and is somehow able to use some of his rogue
          abilities while blinded (another nat20).</li>
        <li>The following fight is short, but brutal. Yarros manages to turn invisible and cast a timely command on the
          Harlequin, Cadenza dodges the volleys of crossbow bolts and is able to string the killer like a pinata. Syn is
          able to stabilize Endhal and Xander is quick to go in for the kill. As the Harlequin draws his last breath,
          skewered from all sides, he swells up like a balloon and blows up.</li>
        <li>In the sky floats the Harlequin hat, bells gently ringing as it lands on the crazed fan, still enraptured.
          The hat instantly kills him, now controlling his body as the next Harlequin killer. As Xander runs up to it to
          hopefully finish the job, the Harlequin curiously exclaims some words in Abyssal, some of which Syn remembers
          later on. Something in those words triggers a complete change in Xander, and he changes his sights to Syn.
        </li>
        <li>As Syn fends off Xander, the rest of the party take care of the remaining fight. They are eventually able to
          snap him out of it, and Xander panics as he is once again made aware that he cannot remember his own actions.
        </li>
        <li>Remembering how to handle dangerous artifacts, the group places the hat in a closed box, though Cadenza
          hears its whispers in her head as she approaches.</li>
        <li>Having lost most of his buzz, Yarros approaches the group, and a piece of a salamander mask drops from his
          pouch. The group had already considered having him accompany them back to the abode, but with this, the deal
          was sealed. Once the party is back, Yarros takes a well-deserved shower that is so good he almost cries.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="date-section no-title">
      <ul>
        <li>That night, Cadenza has a nightmare. She thinks of her meeting with Solara the night before, and how she had promised her friend that she would rely on them if need be… But also remember that last time, she didn’t trust them to do this, didn’t want to harm them… and that she had run without saying goodbye. She dreams of the Harlequin hat, which whispers sweet words of deliverance… of letting go. As the temptation rises, she wakes up in the late morning, covered in sweat.</li>
        <li>While Cadenza was sleeping, Zirelios came by as promised, breakfast ingredients in hand for everyone. As he invites Xander and the others to cook with him, he congratulates them on a successful hunt. As they eat, Xander confides in his brother that he had once again lost control, but after Zirelios reassures him that they would figure this out together, the group starts looking into the Abyssal words that Syn remembers.</li>
        <li>Eventually, Zirelios bids the party goodbye, saying that he had some business to attend to in Pendrath, but that he would be back in around two weeks in time for the big conferences at Crossroads Hall to start. Before parting, however, he asks Xander and the gang to take on a request he’s gotten: To find for sure if the controversial painter, <strong>Grendell</strong>, is indeed currently in the City of Crossroads to replace an old painting of hers currently displayed in the House of Culture. The name of the painting is ‘The Returning Flare’, an old nickname for Melchior that Syn remembers.</li>
        <li>Once Cadenza is awake and caught up on everything, the group evaluates their immediate plans, and decide to take on Zirelios’ request and bring the Harlequin hat to the underground to cash in the mark.</li>
        <li>The original owners of the contract, Endhal and Xander, depart for the Coals in search of an entrance to the City of Crossroads’ criminal underground. Letting their roguish instincts guide them, the two eventually come across a roguish individual stepping into an alleyway way a hefty sack. Following them, they are astonished to see their acquaintance Skewart preparing a bit of a grilling cookout in the alley behind his workplace. He invites the two to join him, but the two reluctantly refuse. They instead tell him they’ll be back after their business is done, should he still be there.</li>
        <li>After bidding Skewart goodbye with a heavy heart and an empty stomach, Endhal and Xander stake out the coal, with Xander doing his best to fend off the mental pressure the boxed Harlequin hat exudes. Eventually, they come across an entrance to the Underground.</li>
        <li>After being let in, the two rogues turn in the box containing the Harlequin hat and get paid 800 gold for a unique bounty turned in. They then inquire about other bounties, and are given the ones for Rel and the White Dragon, as well as a mysterious unidentified winged humanoid creature causing mayhem in the Mayall plains: ‘Marcel’. Despite Xander really wanting to take it on, Endhal manages to get him out of the Underground.</li>
        <li>Xander and Endhal don’t make it back in time for the rest of the cookout.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, Cadenza, Syn and Yarros travel to the House of Culture in search of clues about either Grendell or her painting, the “Returning Flare”. The initial search is thorough, but less than fruitful. Yarros approaches a teller and asks about the painter, but is told that no one with that name has an exhibited work. Cadenza is quick to follow, but after trying to mind game the teller into revealing something, the older lady only chuckles at her attempts. For the rest of the search, Cadenza maintains a one-sided dislike for the teller.</li>
        <li>Syn searches the galleries, but comes back empty-handed. From there, their investigation turns a bit cold until Cadenza recalls having seen a secretive exchange of a red coin with a crown on its faces. The three then determine that they must get their hands on one. Shmoozing up to someone that seems in the know reveals that each member of the party must get their own.</li>
        <li>In the open lounge, Yarros is excited to give a performance and takes his place in front of the crowd. Meanwhile, Xander and Endhal join back up with the party. Yarros’ performance awes the crowd of onlookers, and folks line up to tip the performer. In the basket, Yarros finds a silver coin that looks different from the others: it has a crown on both of its faces.</li>
        <li>Xander persters Cadenza to perform as well, annoying her a great deal. He then goes pickpocketing around the House of Culture and with expert sleight of hand, he manages to rob a few attendees blind on the down low. Looking at his spoils, he then notices another crowned coin.</li>
        <li>While Endhal goes off to search for a coin of his own, Syn decides to perform some percussive tunes from his homeland. After borrowing from the bard room, he starts to perform as well. Despite some cheers, Syn doesn’t get a coin.</li>
        <li>Ultimately, Cadenza decides to perform, and retrieves a violin from the bard room. When she comes back to the stage, she notices Solara in the lounge, watching her with wide eyes. Having her friend there emboldens her, and with a combined roll of 30, Cadenza gives one of the best performances this House of Culture has ever seen. Cadenza receives multiple crowned coins, and she shares one with Syn.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, Endhal surveys his options, and in a moment of insight (or delirium), he decides to post up by the painting gallery and brandish his ingredient hunter badge. An impressed child comes to see him, and they are awed at Endhal’s recounting of this badge’s importance. Then, at the child’s request, Endhal gives an impromptu magic show, which awes the child and nearby attendees. One of the servers nearby reveals himself as the child’s father, and thanks Endhal with a crowned coin for indulging his kid.</li>
        <li>With the coins in hand, the party returns to the same teller, and with an alchemical process, turns them the proper crimson color. She directs them to the recital booths. An attendant welcomes them there, and upon seeing their crimson coins, shows them to one of the booths one at a time. Stepping in, each party member then sees the full-body mirror in the booth disappear, as if it was never there. One after the other, they disappear down a staircase.</li>

        <li>The party emerges in a small gallery alight in a dim red glow. At the center of the room is an old performer whose eyes and lips are sewn shut, playing a harp softly. When exploring, the party discovers the following:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Preserved Totems from the Era of Nomads</li>
          <li>Taxidermied monsters and aberrations</li>
          <li>The crown piece of the Child King’s of Pendrath’s wardrobe from 400 years ago, including rich satin robes, bangles and earrings</li>
          <li>A ripped excerpt of the Black Records, on which are names Endhal recognizes</li>
          <li>Other paintings: Myrmidlan’s Betrayal, The Khaganate’s Hubris, The Emerald Hood’s Interpretations, The Jewel of the Wetlands, and etc.</li>
          <li>A few pieces of vermin-like masks</li>
          <li>The Returning Flare painting, by Grendell</li>
        </ol>
        <li>While exploring, Endhal looks towards the performing crone, only to see that she is turned towards him. She gestures to come closer and leans out of the way, just enough for Endhal to see a symbol inscribed on the wall behind her. Endhal then has a vision of an Orator uniting the 13 nomad clans under one banner. In his vision, he interpreted the methods they used as fellowship, and not violence.</li>
        <li>As Syn and the others approach the Returning Flare, Syn once again feels his ‘druid’ patron take control of his mouth. In the Midnight Gallery, a dark cackle echoes as Melchior admires the painting, and declares his glorious return.</li>
        <li>From there, Cadenza approaches another patron that is enjoying the ambience of the Midnight Gallery. She plays up her interest, using her talents of perception to steer the conversation towards Grendell. She mentions hearing from a reliable source that she is to come by soon to change her painting, and the attendee expresses his surprise. He mentions that the transfers are usually so secretive that even the likes of the White Dragon would not be privy to the info.</li>
        <li>From this guy, Cadenza also learns of previous Grendell works, such as ‘The Ultimate Being’ and ‘The King of Undeath’. He is also able to give a bit of a description of Grendell’s physical features.</li>
        <li>After that, the party decides to steal the pieces of mask from their display. Endhal and Xander both fail to pick the complex lock, but using her wit, Cadenza is able to unlock it. The party members whose masks the pieces belonged to gather what is rightfully theirs and before long, the party is out through the exit.</li>
        <li>As the party returns to the streets of Qilin and discuss their next move, they come across Geldine and a few of her Broomsedge kinsmen carrying armor and weapons back home. She tells Xander and Endhal not to worry about a thing, and that she’d be right back at the tavern when ‘this mess’ is over.</li>
