        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cadenza Ama’ati</strong>, <strong>Endhal</strong>, and <strong>Voxanderthol Xeliore</strong> wake up half-buried in the sand. Weary and unaware of anything but the scorching sands around them, they are hesitant to introduce themselves, but begrudgingly agree to keep things civil.</li>
          <li>Climbing over a sizable dune, the three notice a caravan of carts and camels in the distance. They try to catch up while signaling their presence as best they can.</li>
          <li>Eventually, the caravan notices them and doubles back. The three then meet <strong>Gidweline</strong> and her crew, <strong>Lark</strong>, and <strong>Syn</strong>, who had been in a similar situation just hours prior.</li>
          <li>After a brief introduction and inquiring as to just how they also ended up at world’s end, the wily dwarf and her boys allow the stragglers aboard, offering a brief presentation of the lay of the land.</li>
          <li>The party learns of <strong>Genesizh</strong>, a frontier campground erected at the edge of the desert. Gidweline warns the party of its inhabitants: Mercenaries, sellswords and even escaped convicts that are trying to strike gold here in the far reaches of the desert. </li>
          <li>A bit later, as some crew members were unpacking to pass around some food and water, <strong>Iszyre</strong> is discovered hiding inside a cargo crate, unconscious. Rudely awakened, he is quickly detained, but pleads that he is no thief, despite his lack of memory.</li>
          <li>Once acquainted, each party member discovers that they each woke up here with a similar small parcel in their possession, all of which contain pieces of unflattering masks of unknown material. With these masks and similar situations as their only leads, the party decides to stick together for the time being.</li>
          <li>With everyone aboard, the caravan’s trip back to Genesizh resumes. During the day’s travel, Cadenza makes acquaintance with the crispest water she’s ever tasted.</li>
          <li>Upon arrival in Genesizh, the party asks for the nearest tavern, where they then meet <strong>Stark</strong>, the owner of <strong>Stark’s Caravansery</strong>. The Leonin ex-mercenary is quick to make conversation, but hesitant to fully trust. As such, he proposes a bargain, and enlists Syn’s assistance in finding a missing shipment of ale that should have arrived the day before.</li>
          <li>A deal set, the party starts to investigate Genesizh, as well as <strong>Trismegistus</strong>’ presence within the frontier camp. Some party members, like Endhal, prefer to explore the bazaar, while others, like Syn, sneak across the small oasis and into the trading company’s private tents.</li>
          <li>Eventually, after sneaking into Trismegistus’ tents and investigating the waters around the campground, some party members are discovered, and a brawl, with who they determined to be sellswords posing as Trismegistus members, ensues.</li>
          <li>After defeating the posers, the half of the party involved in the brawl find a scribbled note detailing where the shipment was stashed: hidden in the oasis waters.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, the other half of the party was still investigating the bigger Trismegistus tents, and decided to try to sneak inside what they think is the overseer’s lodgings. Upon entering, they are spotted by <strong>Theanosa</strong> and Lark. Theanosa demands to know who they are.</li>
          <li>A hasty yet thorough explanation, as well as one delivered shipment later, the full party finds itself back at Stark’s Caravansery, complimentary drinks in front of them. Cadenza is hesitant to sit with the others, while Endhal outright refuses to. Eventually, they are given free room and board for services rendered, and their first night together in <strong>Al Ahzoth</strong> passes.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>The next morning, happy as can be to receive his goods, Stark apologizes to Syn for not fully trusting them the day before, and gives the group a slightly dated map of the continent.</li>
            <li>That morning, after taking in the world of Al Ahzoth, each party member goes off and does their own thing: Cadenza questions Stark about Theanosa’s trustworthiness. Syn tries to call upon his druidic senses to get a feel of the land, but fails to garner much. Iszyre practices his Tai Chi, trying to dig up fragments of his lost memory. Endhal and Xander spar. Endhal wins handily.</li>
            <li>Some time later, announcing herself at Stark’s, Theanosa addresses the party and lets them know that she is enlisting Lark as her personal assistant until they reach Oasizh. She then requests the party’s help in ‘showing Lark the ropes’, asking them to go out and hunt for some artifacts with him in exchange for a modest sum and first dibs at what they find.</li>
            <li>The party follow a map of Trismegistus’ current artifact digging sites, and find an untouched tract of dunes that they can go investigate. Joining up with Lark, who seems a bit hesitant, and Gidweline’s caravan, the party ventures into the sands of the <strong>Last Frontier</strong>.</li>
            <li>Arriving at the designated location, everyone starts searching for artifacts in the sands. Eventually, they are attacked by swarms of locusts and other pests, but come out on top. During the battle, Lark tries to use a bow and daggers, but as Cadenza quickly notices, he is hardly proficient with them.</li>
            <li>After some more time digging, three artefacts are unearthed: A fleshy one (which is given to Theanosa), a bony one which Xander keeps, and an eggy one which Cadenza pockets.</li>
            <li>The party travels back to Genesizh, where Theanosa informs them of a local appraiser of some skill that lives in <strong>Rubedo</strong>. After some conversation, the party turns in for the night.</li>

            <li>The party spends the day getting their bearings.</li>
            <li>Sometime during the day, they find Lark in the bazaar. He informs them that the scouting party that always preceded the main convoy between Genesizh and Rubedo never reported in; This is a first in many years, as the scouts are trained to spot storms, quicksand and everything else the desert could feasibly throw at them.</li>

            <li>The convoy of caravans from Rubedo arrives on time, but they too had no inkling as to the whereabouts of the scouting party. It’s as if they had vanished into thin air.</li>
            <li>Packing their meagre belongings, the party is introduced to <strong>Alf-Yhlla</strong>, the leader of the usual convoy between Genesizh and Rubedo. After some debate between the party, the Trismegistus rep and the convoy crew, the trip to Rubedo begins a day early.</li>
            <li>En route, Endhal discovers a sizable pile of snow in the sand, still cold to the touch. He hurries to bring another party member to check, but by the time they get there, it has already melted, and others struggle to believe him.</li>
            <li>During the travels, some members of the caravan, as well as Iszyre and Xander, start to feel quite sick. Their condition worsens over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>After a day’s travel, the convoy camps out for the night. Some party members converse with Lark and get to know him better, while some others speak with an exuberant Alfie. Theanosa is aloof, yet also converses briefly.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>Xander and about a dozen other members of the convoy wake up very ill, but the root cause is as of yet unknown.</li>
            <li>Xander’s condition worsens again during the day, and he becomes poisoned. As he got poisoned before other members of the crew, Alfie requests a search of his belongings, asking whether he had obtained something new recently. Eventually, she learns of and finds the bony artifact, which she appraises as a porous stone that is seeping some sort of gas.</li>
            <li>Alfie warns the party about improper storage of unknown artifacts, and directs them to the skilled appraiser they had briefly heard of in Rubedo. She explains that this person would be able to educate them on the topic, and perhaps even teach them the art of appraisal. </li>
            <li>After the stone is placed in a sealed container, the convoy speeds up, hoping to get to Rubedo in record time to treat the sick.</li>
            <li>At some point, during a bit of a sandstorm, Cadenza starts to notice a shimmering white light, and party members start to see a strange vision in one eye and the desert in the other. Over the next few minutes she, Endhal and Iszyre phase into a forest covered in snow.</li>
            <li>As the three above find the bloodied remnants of the lost scouting party in the snow, Xander and Syn try to find their companions, but struggle to perceive the areas in space where they knew they once were in.</li>
            <li>Cadenza, Endhal and Iszyre engage some native folk in combat, with Endhal recognizing their language as Sylvan. Throughout this encounter, all party members continue to experience this strange visual dissonance. When asked, Lark reveals he is experiencing the same thing.</li>
            <li>Successfully defending themselves, the three errant party members somehow return back to the desert, with Iszyre receiving a right fright.</li>
            <li>After discussing and wondering what happened to them, but coming up short on a conclusion, the party and the rest of the convoy arrive in <strong>West Rubedo</strong>. Xander and the rest of the ill folk are gathered and rushed to the Rubedan chapel, where they are seen to by an old goblin woman that locals call <strong>The Matron</strong>.</li>
            <li>Lark and Theanosa leave. Left to their own devices, party members start to explore West Rubedo, and quickly find a town map.</li>
            <li>While exploring, they come across a cryer selling newspapers for a few coppers. Purchasing one, they learn of some local events.</li>
            <li>Eventually arriving at the local tavern, The Other Side, the party enters, only to be greeted by a half-orc being chokeslammed onto a table by an equally-large bugbear. The party eventually comes to know them as <strong>Adard</strong> and <strong>Alf-Bryndel</strong> respectively.</li>
            <li>Following the jarring entrance, Iszyre is antagonized by Adard’s self-proclaimed ‘promoter’, announcing that the champion of the Oasizh Colosseum is back home. Iszyre doesn’t back down, and agrees to take on the champion later that day.</li>
            <li>The party secures room and board at the tavern, and enjoy their drinks of choice. Then, they scout the request board displayed at the entrance, discussing which requests to take. Around this time, Xander comes back from being treated.</li>
            <li>Now back together, the party seeks out <strong>Adelaide Beryl</strong>, the current acting mayoress of West Rubedo, and inquire about their situation, the snowfall, and the winter forest. Adelaide directs them to a published work titled the “<span>Feasibility Index Theoretical Phenomenon</span>” that she had once read in the <strong>Oasizh</strong> great library.</li>
            <li>Bidding Adelaide goodbye, Syn and Xander decide to continue relaxing and exploring. Cadenza, Iszyre and Endhal pay a visit to <strong>Alf-Lahna</strong>’s shop, where they are taught the beginnings of appraisal.</li>
            <li>In the early evening, Iszyre takes on Adard in a spar and wins. Meanwhile, the new appraisers in the party practice the craft inside the tavern, with varying success.</li>
            <li>The party joins the miners of West Rubedo in celebrating their accomplishments in retaking another floor in the once forsaken mines. The Mayor’s daughter, Adelaide Beryl, personally congratulates the town’s miners.</li>
            <li>As the celebration goes on, Xander wanders around town slightly drunk, and eventually comes across a giant, bipedal rat that greets him in a distinguished voice. He introduces himself as <strong>Mammel</strong>, and tells Xander that “<strong>Adalar Warder</strong> <span>would like a drink as well</span>.”</li>
            <li>Almost in disbelief, Xander follows Mammel to the back of the Rubedo guardhouse, where a disheveled and unkempt man with an eyepatch is looking through the small, barred window of a basement cell. Delighted, he requests that Xander share his drink, which he hesitantly passes through the bars.</li>
            <li>Xander makes Adalar and Mammel’s acquaintance, before seeking the rest of the party. They hardly believe his drunken recollection of a rat with a deep voice.</li>
            <li>That night, Syn finds a letter in his room. He opens it to find a missive, a fragrant purple leaf and a piece of a moray mask. He quickly destroys the missive after reading it.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>In the morning, the party gathers for breakfast. They look through the newspaper and the notice board once again. They decide to take on the request to join the miners in clearing out another level of the mines.</li>
            <li>Joining up near one of the entrances to the Rubedan mountain depths, some party members consider the crates of hardhats, before agreeing to wear them just in case. The troupe of miners join up with them soon after, as does Mammel, fully equipped with a pickaxe and his own hardhat. The rest of the party is in disbelief that Xander was telling the truth.</li>
            <li>Separating from the miners and Mammel at a fork, the party ventures into the tunnels, clearing them out of monsters and critters in the dark. Eventually, they reach a corridor with a broken seal, which the miners reinforce as best they can.</li>
            <li>In the mine, Endhal finds a small collection of mining logs. The last pages are brittle and blurred with dried blood. He makes out the name “<strong>Dyorind</strong>” on it, as well as the year 858.</li>
            <li>Back at the tavern for a quick lunch, the party talks with Alf-Bryndel, and learns a bit more about the orphans of Rubedo.</li>
            <li>That day, while shopping around, Endhal gets caught stealing, and has to run damage control. Meanwhile, Iszyre uses this distraction to steal something himself. Following that, Xander gets Endhal to agree to a contest of sorts, with the loser having to take on the request to tell some stories to the orphans.</li>
            <li>They decide on a game involving chasing Cadenza around town. Despite being the one to instigate, Xander’s team loses.</li>
            <li>During the day, Mammel comes to request another drink for his friend. Xander and Iszyre begrudgingly oblige, and bring the man his tankard of brew. Adalar grins and indulges in the drink. When asked about his crimes, he just tells the two that he is exactly where he wants to be: Just laying low for the time being.</li>
            <li>That evening, Xander takes his place in the chapel and tells the orphans of Rubedo a grandiose tale. Mammel is in attendance.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>The party decides it is time to move on to the eastern half of the city, and look into getting some tickets to board a skyship over the mountain range.</li>
            <li>Before boarding, Endhal notices Adelaide looking over the mountain, forlorn. At the same time, Alf-Bryndel seeks out River and asks him if he’d seen Adard.</li>
            <li>Xander goes to say goodbye to the Matron and thanks her for healing him. She accepts his thanks, and rewards him with a statuette of <strong>The Helper</strong>, saying the children loved his stories.</li>
            <li>Iszyre gets approached by an orphan for an autograph, as he’d seen him wipe the floor with Adard.</li>
            <li>In the early afternoon, the party boards the skyship and gets their first good view of the desert. They see the first glimpse of the <strong>Last Station</strong> in the distance. While aboard, some party members ask about the mechanism allowing the ship to fly.</li>
            <li>On a whim, Xander examines his statuette, and notices an insignia carved on the bottom. After asking around, a crew member tells him that this is the symbol of <strong>Rel</strong>, an informant of some renown.</li>
            <li>As the ship lands, the party finds a map of <strong>East Rubedo</strong>, and seeks out the closest tavern. They come across The Good Side, and try the local speciality.</li>
            <li>Sometime during the day, Xander starts acting stranger than usual; He brushes people off, and is cold to others.</li>
            <li>Night falls; Endhal is worried and confronts Xander, but the conversation is terse and one-sided. The situation devolves into a duel. After losing to him every time since coming to Al Ahzoth, Xander handily beats Endhal, and leaves him outside, unconscious.</li>
            <li>During the night, Xander breaks into the Rubedan mines by busting down the eastern blockade, and quickly disposes of everything he encounters.</li>
            <li>Getting to the other side of the mountain, Xander then escorts some robed individuals through the tunnels and back out the eastern side.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Hours later, Xander comes back to his senses in the sand outside the mines. Groggy, he wakes up just in time to see Adalar popping out of the mines and casually thanking him for his service before wandering off.</li>
            <li>With his fit in tatters, Xander desperately tries to find clothes in a nearby farmstead.</li>
            <li>Endhal wakes up at dawn, alarmed, and tries to find Xander in the tavern. He wakes up some of the others and recounts what happened.</li>
            <li>The party reunites at The Good Side. Party members grill Xander about his attitude and actions. Cadenza and Syn are especially tough in their questioning.</li>
            <li>Eventually, Xander is let off the hook, and he goes shopping to replace his lost clothes, and to possibly acquire some new weapons. While shopping, he comes across an individual wearing an emerald hood. “<span>Hello again, my friend. I didn’t expect to see you again so soon.</span>”</li>
            <li>Later that day, there is panic on the streets. Party members rush outside and learn that there was a breach in the barricades to the Rubedan mines. They see that Trismegistus and the town guards are moving to the eastern entrance. that monsters are coming out in droves on the western side. Coming to a decision, they take the first airship back over and jump out to battle.</li>
            <li>During the battle that ensues, a Bodak attacks from the shadows, and Cadenza, Xander, Iszyre, Syn and Lark fall unconscious as a result. While asleep, they remember that before waking in Al Ahzoth, they each had passed onto the next life, but that in the chaos of each of their last moments, an individual wearing an emerald cloak extended a hand.</li>
            <li>Back in the fight, the miners, mercenaries, Lark and the party push back and dispatch the monsters, who have an aversion to sunlight.</li>
            <li>In the aftermath of the battle, Lark comforts a near-catatonic Iszyre and gives him his personal travel blanket. He tells Iszyre that he "<span>remembers everything now</span>”, and swiftly leaves.</li>
            <li>The rest of the party informs Endhal of the memories of their demise. He wonders if that had happened to him as well.</li>
            <li>In the aftermath of the breach, the tunnels are once again sealed and all progress made by the miners is set back to zero. The party eventually learns that eight people had died during the battle.</li>

            <li>Back in East Rubedo, the early risers of the party are visited by <strong>O’Largue</strong>, <strong>Mayor Beryl</strong>’s right hand. He thanks them for their help during the breach incident, and invites them to come to a public funeral to honor the fallen that afternoon.</li>
            <li>As the party prepares to head out that morning, they come across the same individual wearing an emerald hood at the door. “<span>How curious.</span>” he says, “<span>To think that the six of you would end up in the same place.</span>”</li>
            <li>After acknowledging them, the figure disappears, and the party identifies him as <strong>Tiresius Vinea</strong>, the mass murderer they had learned of in the paper.</li>
            <li>The party attends the public funeral held by mayor Beryl in honor of the fallen. They are each awarded a voucher to the charity auction that would be held later that evening.</li>
            <li>The charity auction is held that evening. Each party member bids on their items of choice, whether they be artifacts, food items, or ale.</li>
            <li>As party members exit the Rubedo Theater, they feel an irresistible urge to follow a melody in their head, and they all end up in the quarry nearby.</li>
            <li>That night, the party faces off against Tiresius Vinea, who while vicious, does not seem intent on killing them like his reputation would suggest. He is skilled at manipulating space and the stars, and empowers the group while taking them down.</li>

            <li>In his room, Lark left a clue for the party to find: A small note and a piece of an ant mask. The note reads: “<span>Seek the Mortal Advent</span>”, among other things.</li>
            <li>In Lark’s room, Xander also finds a discarded greatsword, the weapon that Lark had (poorly) used during the breach battle. He takes it for himself.</li>

            <li>After determining that the party is not wholly responsible for the chaos that ensued in Rubedo and his daughter’s disappearance, he further asks about Lark, and then lets everyone go.</li>
            <li>Bluebeak warns Endhal that high elves are not only rare, but in danger around these parts, and tells him a copy of the black records may be found in Oasizh.</li>
            <li>Leaving a bloodied Adalar behind to be further interrogated, the party notes that there is light snowfall outside, each flake turning into rain before it reaches ground. Slowly, they return to the comfort of the Mist Engine’s seats.</li>
            <li>During the trip, Cadenza learns that the tune playing from odd baubles inside the train is the latest hit from an artist with a very familiar name. </li>
            <li>Some odd hours later, Mammel appears in the party’s carriage, and asks Voxanderthol a favor: Adalar Warder would like a drink. </li>
            <li>Reluctantly, Xander brings the man his drink, and watches as he downs it. Both men then discuss recent events, and Xander notes that Adalar seems especially keen on the strange snowfall.</li>
            <li>A few minutes later, grinning through his pain, Adalar asks Xander to help him breakout, as they were already buddies in his eyes.</li>
            <li>Once freed, Adalar quickly opens the compartment’s door, standing on the edge of the train. Mammel then turns into a large bird and scoops him up. The man leaves Xander with the parting words “<span>Our beloved desert; Next time we meet, let me know if you think it’s a good place.</span>”</li>
            <li>Relaying the shenanigans he just witnessed to the rest of the group, the party each begin to rest in their own way.</li>

          <h2 class="date-header">Year 952 - Week of December 23rd</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Arriving in Oasizh, the party wanders towards the city center through <strong>Sanctum Lane</strong>. To help guide the group, Iszyre tries his darndest to remember something, anything, and eventually remembers a tavern he used to be a regular at back over 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>Guided by instinct and hope more than by memory, Iszyre leads the party down into the inner city, and eventually through Amber Lane, all the way to the <strong>Heart’s Haven</strong>.</li>
            <li>Once there, the party is greeted by a large, jolly woman who almost instantly recognizes Iszyre. She tears up, exclaiming that he’s alive after all, and goes to hug him. She then introduces herself as <strong>Hilde</strong>, the now owner of this tavern, whereas she was still a young girl when Iszyre would have visited.</li>
            <li>During a heartfelt conversation, Iszyre is made to remember the name of his old friend and colleague: <strong>Ylvan Rooksol</strong>, the now director of the <strong>Alchemist Association</strong> and author of the lauded <span>Ella Prima Materia</span>.</li>
            <li>After a round of drinks, the party procures a map of town, reads the Oasizh Gazette they had obtained while on the Mist Engine, and asks Hilde about local establishments.</li>
            <li>As Iszyre wants to reconnect the dots in his memories, he quickly announces his intention of visiting the Alchemist Association at <strong>Petrichor Tower</strong>.</li>
            <li>Accompanying Iszyre, the party walk to the <strong>Old Palace Lane</strong>, and into Petrichor Tower, home of the Alchemist Association. They are stopped at the front desk by an enthusiastic, yet exasperated, junior alchemist named <strong>Olive Vayna</strong>.</li>
            <li>Iszyre inquires about meeting Ylvan, but is made to realize that attempting to meet the director of an organization on good faith alone rarely bears fruit. Nevertheless, Olive promises to send a message up the tower and hopefully to Rooksol himself… should Iszyre help her reach her recruitment quota.</li>
            <li>Despite Syn’s misgivings and Cadenza’s suspicions, Iszyre signs up to become an alchemist once again, while Endhal and Xander decide to try to get their own ingredient hunter titles.</li>
            <li>After leaving Petrichor Tower, the party visits the Great Library, which is built in the basement of the ruins of the old Khaganate. Once there, they meet the part-time robotic librarian, <strong>NEMO-IV</strong>.</li>
            <li>Endhal, Iszyre and Xander look for study materials for their upcoming tests in a few days, with the latter two bickering all the while. Cadenza wonders how her fellow rogues can be this idiotic.</li>
            <li>While the others are studying and quizzing each other, Syn tries to dig for dirt on Rooksol, and uncovers an article describing how the man had fallen on hard times prior to publishing his Alma Mater.</li>
            <li>Back at the Heart’s Haven, Cadenza learns that the bard named <strong>Scalesong</strong> is to perform at the Colosseum during the Year’s End festivities, and she decides to get herself a ticket when she has time for herself.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>Around the same time, the party decides to visit Theanosa’s office in <strong>Trismegistus Lane</strong>. Once there, they knock and wait, rinse and repeat, until she finally opens the door, grumpy from all the attention her promotion is bringing her.</li>
            <li>Seeing that it’s people she at least deemed useful, she lets the party in and over some tea, gives them a quick rundown of what’s been happening on her side.</li>
            <li>The party also asks about Lark’s whereabouts, but she recounts that he made himself scarce as soon as they reached Oasizh. She believes he headed south, and vaguely remembers him mentioning a companion or two.</li>
            <li>During the same meeting, Theanosa learns of Iszyre being a changeling, and greedily asks if he would replace her from time to time in exchange for a not-so-modest sum of gold.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>The next day, over breakfast, Hilde comes to Iszyre and asks him and the group for assistance. She tells the party that her friend <strong>Jacynth</strong> is in a bit of a pinch, as criminals broke into her store and forced her out at swordpoint, then occupying her space for the last few days. As Trismegistus and the city guard are spread too thin planning the Year’s End festival, her friend needs some help taking out the trash.</li>
            <li>Accepting the request, the party ventures into the <strong>Rounds</strong> and into its poorer neighbourhoods, eventually locating Jacynth’s shop. With Endhal’s expert use of an invisible mage hand and some lockpicks, the party infiltrates the building.</li>
            <li>A fight breaks out both in and out of the shop, but the party comes out on top without too much trouble. After tying up the criminals and forcing a confession out of their leader, they investigate the store.</li>
            <li>Apart from confessing to their involvement here, the party manages to eke out an extra detail: where the money transfer was being conducted.</li>
            <li>In a locked room, Syn finds a few crates which, when opened, seem to contain nothing but thousands upon thousands of purple leaves. The shipment tag reads “Verana Leaves”, the key ingredient to making Verana Compound, which the criminals had been smoking.</li>
            <li>Taking a few leaves for analysis, the party leaves the criminals and crates for the authorities to find.</li>
            <li>A few hours later, the party visits the place in question, which is the <strong>Oasizh Greenhouse</strong> located near the junction to Trismegistus Lane. There, some members keep watch while the others search for a loose stone, eventually finding it.</li>
            <li>In the small hollow space in the wall, the party finds a bag of 40 gold and a note. It reads: "<span>There will be a lot more work soon. They'll be in touch. E</span>"</li>
            <li>The party conducts a brief survey of the greenhouse, trying to find anything of note, but struggles to do so for now. They do talk to some employees, who tell them of the Greenhouse’s caretaker: <strong>Embermawl</strong> of Trismegistus</li>
            <li>As the party leaves, Syn, who had wild-shaped into a cat, senses an intense stare from a greenhouse window. As he turns, he catches the shadow of a dragonborn.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>During the week, as the preparations for the Year’s End Festival ramp up, Iszyre receives a note from Ylvan saying that he’ll meet him on the evening of the festival, and that he should take the shortcut through the tower that they all used to be so fond of.</li>
            <li>Around the same time, Cadenza tries to go to <strong>Champion’s Lane</strong> by herself to get her ticket, but her companions insist on following her, asking her what’s going on. After some arguing about privacy and honesty, she finally reveals that the famed musician that would perform at the tourney, Sir Scalesong, might be someone she knows well.</li>
            <li>Iszyre and Xander are excited at the prospect of meeting a friend of Cadenza’s. Much to her chagrin, the whole party purchases tickets to the tourney.</li>
            <li>Prior to the festival proper, the party learns of a drink-making competition that would be hosted across many of the Oasizh taverns. The Heart’s Haven is no exception, and Xander decides to sign up for it.</li>
            <li>Xander asks Iszyre about local special ingredients that he, as a former alchemist of reputable skill, would know about. Digging inside his memories, Iszyre remembers a type of worm that lives on the oasis banks in the city.</li>
            <li>The party goes fishing for worms around the shore near the Heart’s Haven and make a small competition out of it. Eventually, they gather enough that Xander would be able to test out a concoction before the day of the competition.</li>
            <li>Sometime before the festival, Syn also decides to help out around the Rounds and the Hills, eventually meeting the second seat of Trismegistus: <strong>Madam Silksands</strong>.</li>
            <li>While Syn is out, the party also returns to the Great Library. Cadenza reads up about the history of the colosseum tourney while the three others continue to study for their entrance examination, which looms right around the corner.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>Around the beginning of the festival, Iszyre, Xander and Endhal gather at Petrichor Tower for their exam, and all three manage to get their badges. They are given three months to present any sort of progress to a board of alchemists in order to retain access to the tower’s facilities. Xander and Endhal’s rivalry is temporarily quelled once they notice they both succeeded.</li>
            <li>Following that, the party gathers at the Heart’s Haven, just in time for festivities to really get started. As the brewing contest begins, Xander is put against three others: The Oasizh Fruit Sour, Breeze and Brine.</li>
            <li>The first half of the contest doesn’t exactly go Xander’s way, but with some assistance from the party and interference from Iszyre, he manages to come out on top, and his drink is crowned by Hilde as 952’s best.</li>
            <li>On the official Year’s End holiday, Cadenza goes to attend the events at the colosseum. Her seat is away from the others. As she takes her place amongst the crowd, she surveys the competitors and different types of crowds cheering for their respective champions.</li>
            <li>During the opening ceremony, <strong>Chairman Romnil</strong> of Trismegistus kicks things off before leaving the stage to a young Dragonborn, who Cadenza instantly recognizes. He plays his now famous “<span>Echoes</span>” and the fights are quickly underway.</li>
            <li>Once the fights are over and a new champion is crowned best fighter of 952, the party reunites in the busy Champion’s Lane. They wait around for a little bit, and eventually, Antonin Scalesong emerges from the colosseum surrounded by bodyguards.</li>
            <li>Hesitant to talk to him, Cadenza is satisfied to just have confirmed this was indeed her friend, but Xander, Syn and Iszyre didn’t want to leave it at that. With Cadenza’s hesitant approval, they pretend to be some journalists and push through the crowd.</li>
            <li>Once they get near the musician, the three manage to get his attention, and he stops to answer a few questions. Through his words, the three clock him as a prideful person who takes great care to uphold his family’s name, but he is nevertheless honest and forthcoming with his answers. He is especially insistent that his “Echoes” is only the first of four movements. Once they get back, Cadenza assures them that he means well despite his quirks.</li>
            <li>Later in the day, the party finally lets themselves relax and take part in the festivities. Some, like Cadenza and Xander, compete in carnival games to win some small prizes, while others like Endhal seek the magic demonstrations in Petrichor Tower.</li>
            <li>As his companions are having a good time, Iszyre is counting the minutes to sunset, nervous about meeting his old friend. In his mind,the past is still shrouded in darkness, but he is determined to get some answers.</li>
            <li>A few hours later, Iszyre and co. enter Petrichor Tower with the intent to find the shortcut and meet Ylvan Rooksol in his office. Going off of pure instinct Iszyre leads them to a corridor in the far back of the tower, where they eventually discover a mechanism that they struggle to operate. Then, almost by accident, Iszyre triggers it, and a rotating wall kidnaps him to a small elevator, which swiftly takes off.</li>
            <li>Still suspicious of Rooksol’s intentions, the party decide to forgo waiting for the elevator to come all the way back down, and instead start to ascend the tower the old fashioned way. In a rush, they stumble upon Olive Vayna, who is drunk out of her mind celebrating her promotion. The party bribes her with more alcohol, and she tells them of a secret passage she had found just recently.</li>
            <li>For Iszyre, the elevator ride up is nerve-wracking. He hesitates, but still decides to keep wearing Ylvan’s face as he pictured it, the face of a friend from 30 years ago. </li>
            <li>Eventually, a back wall slides open and Iszyre emerges from the elevator. He steps into a room full of stopwatches, some built, others in the process of. Facing away and wearing a hood, a man is waiting for him, tinkering. On his back, proudly displayed, are the emblems of the Alchemist Association and of Trismegistus.</li>
            <li>The conversation between Iszyre and Ylvan is full of hope from one side, and cold from the other. As Iszyre hesitantly asks how his friend is, Ylvan seems to get heated:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>"<span>…I'm getting angry. Why are you acting like this? Does it bring you satisfaction to mimic the ailments of my old age? I've long considered it an honor that you seemed to favor my appearance, but even that has its limits, Iszyre… Have you truly forgotten what you’ve done?</span>"</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Quelling his feelings, Ylvan apologizes and invites Iszyre to join him on the roof of the tower, as there is much that the two need to air out. Iszyre follows him there, and they continue talking about the past.</li>
            <li>The conversation is heavy, and Iszyre is unable to keep up with Ylvan’s words. Eventually, both fall into an uncomfortable silence, both looking at the sunset. Then, Ylvan speaks some parting words:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>“<span>Even now, after everything you've pushed me to do, I still cannot bring myself to distrust you… so struggle, Iszyre. Struggle until you remember what you've done… and the truth behind what happened.</span>”</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Before he could react, Iszyre is then pushed off the edge of the tower by a pair of large paws, and he falls down 30 feet down and onto an open balcony. He falls unconscious from the shock.</li>
            <li>Shortly after, Iszyre wakes up in a dark, dusty room. Lighting a torch, he comes to realize that this is <em>his</em> old workshop: <strong>Professor Gregor</strong>. He remembers scenes of them writing theories on a blackboard, and of friendly academic debates. Then, he finally remembers Ylvan giving him a glass pocket watch, which he finds inside a dusty box. Inside the same box, he finds a memo directing him to the Oasizh Great Library.</li>
            <li>As Iszyre is finding a way out of the workshop, the others reach the secret passage, which opens to a large spiral staircase leading far up into the tower. Following that, Iszyre manages to rejoin the party, and together they dispatch an automaton built by Gregor who was tasked with protecting the passage.</li>
            <li>Iszyre gets the others up to speed on the situation, before dragging them to the library to look for the following clue. Once there, he asks for a book on Oasizh’s prosperous dancing parlors. As soon as it is in his hands, he tears it open to a page tarnished in red ink. The page describes <strong>The Swaying Pearl</strong>, a pleasure house located in <strong>Saccharine Lane.</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>The following morning, the party goes on a trek to the Rounds, and to Saccharine Lane, which is one step from being a full-blown red light district in the slums. Once there, they enter and start to look for the "<span>foulest, plumpest wench in the house: one so horrid that even the sun is repulsed</span>".</li>
            <li>The party discovers a painting of a very rotund lady that spans from floor to ceiling, which they push ajar and step through. From there, they enter a district of the Oasizh Underground. Right up front, they meet <strong>Aelvina</strong>, an ambitious vedalken who is quick to take Xander as a criminal contact.</li>
            <li>From there, as Iszyre inquires about something possibly being left behind for him, everyone goes out to explore the underground on their own. Aelvina takes Iszyre to a depo of sorts, where she rummages through some files before pulling out a package with his name on it.</li>
            <li>While eying the various merchants of dubious means, Cadenza comes across <strong>Knox Brassworth</strong>, a magnanimous halfling merchant who proposes a deal of exclusivity on the knickknacks Cadenza gathers… in exchange for a good price on a few familiar mask pieces.</li>
            <li>Once Aelvina is back, Xander asks if any marks were available. The only possible ones at their current level is a mark for a serial killer with the sobriquet <strong>The Harlequin</strong> who is running rampant somewhere in the <strong>City of Crossroads</strong>.</li>
            <li>While walking with the rest of the group, Endhal notices a strange marking repeating across the walls. Curious, he approaches, and somehow triggers a vision about a certain <strong>Well’s Chosen</strong>. Following that, he finds that a new spell is on the tip of his tongue.</li>
            <li>Back aboveground, the party wander back into the inner city, where they run into Chairman Romnil of Trismegistus hurrying other members to pack as many crates of supplies as possible onto carts. When asked, he comfortably shares that the storm of the decade is fast approaching Oasizh.</li>
            <li>While the day is still young, and knowing that their remaining time in Oasizh could be short, Endhal and Xander decide to go back to the Greenhouse and investigate further.</li>
            <li>The basement is dimly lit, but just enough that the two rogues can move safely. As they tiptoe around some exotic plants, they hear a voice coming from the other end of the room. Approaching, they take position and listen in:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>"<span>My lord, why is the scent of your eternal pyre amidst this stench… I need not be tested. I know that feline had to have been a druid. I shall NOT be doubted. Just watch me… your apostle will spread your fiery name across the world.</span>"</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Getting just  a little bit closer, Xander and Endhal are able to see a dragonborn changing clothes, and have a peek at the vicious, monstrous fox tattoo on their back.</li>
            <li>Turning around to Endhal, Xander is barely able to notice a carnivorous plant’s mouth close in around Endhal’s head. Unable to speak out, Xander desperately tries to warn his friend, and is able to at the last possible moment. For a second there, Xander had almost accepted he’d see his friend die right there.</li>
            <li>On their way out, Xander is still shaken and fails to properly sneak, alerting the dragonborn. They notice immediately, but the rogues had already hightailed it.</li>
            <li>In the evening, the party reunites at the Heart’s Haven. Xander and Endhal recount what they saw, and Syn cringes in anger. After taking a deep breath, he shares his origins as part of the <strong>Brotherhood of the Blazing Fox</strong>, and asks for help taking down who must be Embermawl.</li>
            <li>Aware of the dangers that await, everyone agrees to help Syn.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>In the evening, the party moves out.</li>
            <li>As they walk through Trismegistus Lane and into the greenhouse, they forgo stealth, and burst into the basement. Embermawl is waiting for them there.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>“<span>It’s you. You’re that wrench’s little pet.</span>”</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Syn confronts Embermawl, crying out that the cult had taken everything from him, but no longer.</li>
            <li>A brutal, fiery battle ensues. Iszyre is badly burned, but the party is otherwise successful in dispatching Embermawl… that is, until their downed bodied is rekindled by fire and hatred. The <strong>Great Fiend Melchior</strong> speaks through Syn’s mouth:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>"<span>Rise, Embermawl of the Propagation. I have use of your ashes yet…</span>" </li>
            </ul>
            <li>The party feels the fiend’s gaze behind the dragonborn. The fight is brutal, and the greenhouse burns down more by the second. The party comes out on top in the end, but are barely able to salvage anything from Embermawl’s remains or their office.</li>
            <li>Limping back up the stairs, the door out of the basement seems stuck, but Theanosa had spotted them going into the greenhouse earlier, and as it started burning down, came to see what was happening.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>After the events at the Oasizh Greenhouse, the party decides to try to dodge the oncoming storm of the decade that is on its way. As such, they board the last Mist Engine bound east, towards the <strong>Eastern Watchtower</strong>. Their intent is to go down towards the City of Crossroads, where they know both Rel and the Harlequin are situated. They also know that Lark headed south some time ago, and hope to maybe catch wind of him eventually.</li>
            <li>The group bids adieu to Hilde and the Heart’s Haven, and visits Theanosa to thank her for the day prior. She waves them off, but nevertheless reminds them that she has not forgotten her deal with a certain changeling.</li>
            <li>As the party boards the train and bids the city of alchemy goodbye, they witness a heavy snowfall mix in with the harsh winds.</li>
            <li>En route, Iszyre struggles to open Gregor’s notebook, but after several attempts, finally succeeds in cracking it open.</li>
            <li>For the next few hours, Iszyre’s world is shattered, as he reads of his old colleague’s final days in Oasizh. At the tail end of it, he finally recalls the fateful day where Ylvan made them both drink poison.</li>
            <li>Iszyre’s companions immediately notice that something’s wrong with him and ask him about it. They are appalled when he tries to lie to them about what he’s read (especially Cadenza, who recalls Iszyre asking her to be more open and honest with them).</li>
            <li>For the next few hours, feelings are put on the table, and some arguments ensue, but in the end, the party seems a bit closer as a result.</li>
            <li>The train ride is smooth, but some party members are worried that the engines can double as bombs whenever Iszyre desires to.</li>

            <li>The party arrives at the Eastern Watchtower and disembark. As they do, the winds have picked up; The storm is nigh.</li>
            <li>Stepping inside, they are still indecisive as to how they would travel. Both the airship across to the <strong>Mayall</strong> region and taking a ship down river directly to the City of Crossroads have merit.</li>
            <li>Deciding to explore their options, the party investigates the price of airship tickets, the amount of seats still available, and etc. Ultimately, they decide to take their chances with the turbulent waters.</li>
            <li>In order to get passage, they meet up with renowned, retired captain <strong>Brynn Stormhelm</strong>. A bit of a hardass, she gives them a price and a condition: each recruit at least one more passenger to make her time more worth it.</li>
            <li>Through some good conversations and shenanigans, the group recruits the following:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A travelling cook that loves to look like a rogue, but really isn’t one.</li>
              <li>An older, cynical woman named <strong>Lanar</strong>. She gives Endhal the stink eye.</li>
              <li><strong>Elaine</strong>, a young and exuberant bard that thinks her skills can easily replace gold coins needed for passage.</li>
              <li>A boy, his mother and her brothers.</li>
              <li>An impoverished citizen of Rubedo looking for a new life elsewhere.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>As he is recruiting Elaine, Xander receives a few Sending messages from his brother. He asks for his whereabouts and where he’s going. He also warns against going to the <strong>Sardior Range</strong>, as the beast of the mountain hates him, and would kill Xander at first whiff of his scent.</li>
            <li>Once all passengers are recruited and their passage down river secured, the party boards the Iron Gull. Captain Stormhelm informs them of their responsibility to protect the ship and assist the crew until they clear the rougher waters.</li>
            <li>And rough they are. Multiple times as Captain Stormhelm braves whirlpools and the storm do the party almost feel themselves going overboard. The journey is long and arduous, and for the whole day, passengers have to brace themselves. Cadenza, aided by her earrings, helps the Captain at the helm.</li>
            <li>Eventually, a passenger falls overboard, and Syn jumps after him, wildshaping into a Walrus. Iszyre almost falls down himself, but is saved by transforming into Xander with horns, which the latter grabs onto.</li>
            <li>Later, once the worst has passed, Syn regrets that he was unable to help one of the two brothers that had gone overboard. With the loss of this person, the mood is sombre, yet the crew persists.</li>
            <li>That evening, the older elven woman visits Endhal, and calling him by his elven name, tells him that they must talk posthaste. In the quick exchange that follows Endhal learns of her animosity towards him, as well as the role that high elves play in these lands.</li>

            <li>The turbulent voyage downriver continues the next day. Captain Stormhelm and Cadenza expertly navigate the currents, and the ship sails at unbelievable speeds.</li>
            <li>Mulling over what he has learned, and still questioning what exactly it means to “interpret” the very land, Endhal is quiet and ignores his companion’s questioning looks.</li>
            <li>The day passes by, and as the others are having dinner, Endhal and Lanar retreat to the captain’s cabin to continue their conversation. Much is revealed, including Lanar’s relation to him, the nature of the Black Records, and the <strong>Aeternum Institute</strong>’s involvement with the revival of their village’s sacred ancestor.</li>
            <li>Eventually, Lanar proposes an alliance of necessity, and Endhal reluctantly agrees.</li>
            <li>Xander and Iszyre, ever the busybodies, follow them and eavesdrop from outside the cabin. As the conversation dies down, Lanar kicks open the door, addressing them. Endhal is not pleased.</li>
            <li>That night, the ship drops anchor, and everyone makes camp by the riverside. As Elaine plays a sorrowful, yet hopeful tune, each party member longs for home… “<span>The place of their rebirth, oh so near.</span>”</li>

            <li>As the ship sets sail the next day, Xander feels a strange, foreboding feeling. He seems clumsier than usual, tripping everywhere and failing at the most basic tasks. However, as he was alert, he was able to sense a wyvern coming before it swooped down and attacked the ship!</li>
            <li>The Captain and the crew retreat below deck as the party bursts into combat. Elaine supports a few members with inspiration and also retreats. As the battle unfolds, crew members with arquebus support the party.</li>
            <li>After dispatching the two wyverns, the party wonders why they were attacked. The looming might of the Sardior Range in the distance offers a plausible source, but not the cause.</li>
            <li>Later, the ship makes a stop at <strong>Rach’s End</strong>, a small village at the foot of the range. There is a long, snaking path that supposedly goes to a nearby monastery. About half of the passengers disembark, including Lanar, who once again warns Endhal, and gives him a pearl, telling him to meditate with it at night.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>“<span>Well then; Keep your wits about you, Metta’ain. If all goes well, we will both live long lives far, far away from each other.</span>”</li>
            </ul>
            <li>That night, Endhal meditates, and has a vision of himself as a crow inside some desert ruins. He sees one of his kind trying to hide and run away, but they are found and captured by a band of skilled hunters wearing tanned cloaks.</li>
            <li>Endhal comes back to, covered in sweat.</li>

            <li>Set to arrive at the city of crossroads early the next day, party members try to relax in their own way as the ship sails through a tranquil <strong>Morgin’s Pass</strong>.</li>
            <li>Nearing noon, as the ship was crossing under jutting stone pillars, Xander is put under suggestion, and thinks it a good idea to go on deck by himself. Once there, a humanoid figure addresses him, and attacks him with a high-level spell. Xander fails to dodge in time and sees his life fly before his eyes, but is saved by a countering spell from the opposite direction.</li>
            <li>Xander recognizes his brother as both figures start casting more spells, each meeting in the middle, as the ship continues to sail by. Xander is quick to inform the others that his brother saved him.</li>
            <li>Just before nightfall, what began as a gut feeling turns into a memory:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>“<span>Having heard your tale —and I apologize for having to make this decision for you—, what represents you best must be…</span>”</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Party members switch out their mask pieces, finding the ones that truly belong to them.</li>
