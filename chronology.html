        <ol>
          <li>Cadenza Ama’ati, Endhal, and Voxanderthol Xeliore wake up half-buried in the sand. Weary and unaware of anything but the scorching sands around them, they are hesitant to introduce themselves, but begrudgingly agree to keep things civil.</li>
          <li>Climbing over a sizable dune, the three notice a caravan of carts and camels in the distance. They try to catch up while signaling their presence as best they can.</li>
          <li>Eventually, the Caravan notices them and doubles back. The three then meet <strong>Gidweline</strong> and her crew, <strong>Lark</strong>, and Syn, who had been in a similar situation just hours prior.</li>
          <li>After a brief introduction and inquiring as to just how they also ended up at world’s end, the wily dwarf and her boys allow the stragglers aboard, offering a brief presentation of the lay of the land.</li>
          <li>The party learns of <strong>Genesizh</strong>, a frontier campground erected at the edge of the desert. Gidweline warns the party of its inhabitants: Mercenaries, sellswords and even escaped convicts that are trying to strike gold here in the far reaches of the desert. </li>
          <li>A bit later, as some crew members were unpacking to pass around some food and water, Iszyre is discovered hiding inside a cargo crate, unconscious. Rudely awakened, he is quickly detained, but pleads that he is no thief, despite his lack of memory.</li>
          <li>Once acquainted, each party member discovers that they each woke up here with a similar small parcel in their possession, all of which contain pieces of unflattering masks of unknown material. With these masks and similar situations as their only leads, the party decides to stick together for the time being.</li>
          <li>With everyone aboard, the caravan’s trip back to Genesizh resumes. During the day’s travel, Cadenza makes acquaintance with the crispest water she’s ever tasted.</li>
          <li>Upon arrival in Genesizh, the party asks for the nearest tavern, where they then meet Stark, the owner of <em>Stark’s Caravansery</em>. The Leonin ex-mercenary is quick to make conversation, but hesitant to fully trust. As such, he proposes a bargain, and enlists Syn’s assistance in finding a missing shipment of ale that should have arrived the day before.</li>
          <li>A deal set, the party starts to investigate Genesizh, as well as <strong>Trismegistus</strong>’ presence within the frontier camp. Some party members, like Endhal, prefer to explore the bazaar, while others, like Syn, sneak across the small oasis and into the trading company’s private tents.</li>
          <li>Eventually, after sneaking into Trismegistus’ tents and investigating the waters around the campground, some party members are discovered, and a brawl, with who they determined to be sellswords posing as Trismegistus members, ensues.</li>
          <li>After defeating the posers, the half of the party involved in the brawl find a scribbled note detailing where the shipment was stashed: hidden in the oasis waters.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, the other half of the party was still investigating the bigger Trismegistus tents, and decided to try to sneak inside what they think is the overseer’s lodgings. Upon entering, they are spotted by <strong>Theanosa</strong> and Lark. Theanosa demands to know who they are.</li>
          <li>A hasty yet thorough explanation, as well as one delivered shipment later, the full party finds itself back at Stark’s Caravansery, complimentary drinks in front of them. Cadenza is hesitant to sit with the others, while Endhal outright refuses to. Eventually, they are given free room and board for services rendered, and their first night together in Al Ahzoth passes.</li>
        </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>The next morning, happy as can be to receive his goods, Stark apologizes to Syn for not fully trusting them the day before, and gives the group a slightly dated map of the continent.</li>
            <li>That morning, after taking in the world of Al Ahzoth, each party member goes off and does their own thing: Cadenza questions Stark about Theanosa’s trustworthiness. Syn tries to call upon his druidic senses to get a feel of the land, but fails to garner much. Iszyre practices his Tai Chi, trying to dig up fragments of his lost memory. Endhal and Xander spar. Endhal wins handily.</li>
            <li>Some time later, announcing herself at Stark’s, Theanosa addresses the party and lets them know that she is enlisting Lark as her personal assistant until they reach Oasizh. She then requests the party’s help in ‘showing Lark the ropes’, asking them to go out and hunt for some artifacts with him in exchange for a modest sum and first dibs at what they find.</li>
            <li>The party follow a map of Trismegistus’ current artifact digging sites, and find an untouched tract of dunes that they can go investigate. Joining up with Lark, who seems a bit hesitant, and Gidweline’s caravan, the party ventures into the sands of the Last Frontier.</li>
            <li>Arriving at the designated location, everyone starts searching for artifacts in the sands. Eventually, they are attacked by swarms of locusts and other pests, but come out on top. During the battle, Lark tries to use a bow and daggers, but as Cadenza quickly notices, he is hardly proficient with them.</li>
            <li>After some more time digging, three artefacts are unearthed: A fleshy one (which is given to Theanosa), a bony one which Xander keeps, and an eggy one which Cadenza pockets.</li>
            <li>The party travels back to Genesizh, where Theanosa informs them of a local appraiser of some skill that lives in Rubedo. After some conversation, the party turns in for the night.</li>

            <li>The party spends the day getting their bearings.</li>
            <li>Sometime during the day, they find Lark in the bazaar. He informs them that the scouting party that always preceded the main convoy between Genesizh and Rubedo never reported in; This is a first in many years, as the scouts are trained to spot storms, quicksand and everything else the desert could feasibly throw at them.</li>

            <li>The convoy of caravans from Rubedo arrives on time, but they too had no inkling as to the whereabouts of the scouting party. It’s as if they had vanished into thin air.</li>
            <li>Packing their meagre belongings, the party is introduced to Alf-Yhlla, the leader of the usual convoy between Genesizh and Rubedo. After some debate between the party, the Trismegistus rep and the convoy crew, the trip to Rubedo begins a day early.</li>
            <li>En route, Endhal discovers a sizable pile of snow in the sand, still cold to the touch. He hurries to bring another party member to check, but by the time they get there, it has already melted, and others struggle to believe him.</li>
            <li>During the travels, some members of the caravan, as well as Iszyre and Xander, start to feel quite sick. Their condition worsens over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>After a day’s travel, the convoy camps out for the night. Some party members converse with Lark and get to know him better, while some others speak with an exuberant Alfie. Theanosa is aloof, yet also converses briefly.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>Xander and about a dozen other members of the convoy wake up very ill, but the root cause is as of yet unknown.</li>
            <li>Xander’s condition worsens again during the day, and he becomes poisoned. As he got poisoned before other members of the crew, Alfie requests a search of his belongings, asking whether he had obtained something new recently. Eventually, she learns of and finds the bony artifact, which she appraises as a porous stone that is seeping some sort of gas.</li>
            <li>Alfie warns the party about improper storage of unknown artifacts, and directs them to the skilled appraiser they had briefly heard of in Rubedo. She explains that this person would be able to educate them on the topic, and perhaps even teach them the art of appraisal. </li>
            <li>After the stone is placed in a sealed container, the convoy speeds up, hoping to get to Rubedo in record time to treat the sick.</li>
            <li>At some point, during a bit of a sandstorm, Cadenza starts to notice a shimmering white light, and party members start to see a strange vision in one eye and the desert in the other. Over the next few minutes she, Endhal and Iszyre phase into a forest covered in snow.</li>
            <li>As the three above find the bloodied remnants of the lost scouting party in the snow, Xander and Syn try to find their companions, but struggle to perceive the areas in space where they knew they once were in.</li>
            <li>Cadenza, Endhal and Iszyre engage some native folk in combat, with Endhal recognizing their language as Sylvan. Throughout this encounter, all party members continue to experience this strange visual dissonance. When asked, Lark reveals he is experiencing the same thing.</li>
            <li>Successfully defending themselves, the three errant party members somehow return back to the desert, with Iszyre receiving a right fright.</li>
            <li>After discussing and wondering what happened to them, but coming up short on a conclusion, the party and the rest of the convoy arrive in West Rubedo. Xander and the rest of the ill folk are gathered and rushed to the Rubedan chapel, where they are seen to by an old goblin woman that locals call The Matron.</li>
            <li>Lark and Theanosa leave. Left to their own devices, party members start to explore West Rubedo, and quickly find a town map.</li>
            <li>While exploring, they come across a cryer selling newspapers for a few coppers. Purchasing one, they learn of some local events.</li>
            <li>Eventually arriving at the local tavern, The Other Side, the party enters, only to be greeted by a half-orc being chokeslammed onto a table by an equally-large bugbear. The party eventually comes to know them as Adard and Alf-Bryndel respectively.</li>
            <li>Following the jarring entrance, Iszyre is antagonized by Adard’s self-proclaimed ‘promoter’, announcing that the champion of the Oasizh Colosseum is back home. Iszyre doesn’t back down, and agrees to take on the champion later that day.</li>
            <li>The party secures room and board at the tavern, and enjoy their drinks of choice. Then, they scout the request board displayed at the entrance, discussing which requests to take. Around this time, Xander comes back from being treated.</li>
            <li>Now back together, the party seeks out Adelaide Beryl, the current acting mayoress of West Rubedo, and inquire about their situation, the snowfall, and the winter forest. Adelaide directs them to a published work titled the “Feasibility Index Theoretical Phenomenon” that she had once read in the Oasizh great library.</li>
            <li>Bidding Adelaide goodbye, Syn and Xander decide to continue relaxing and exploring. Cadenza, Iszyre and Endhal pay a visit to Alf-Lahna’s shop, where they are taught the beginnings of appraisal.</li>
            <li>In the early evening, Iszyre takes on Adard in a spar and wins. Meanwhile, the new appraisers in the party practice the craft inside the tavern, with varying success.</li>
            <li>The party joins the miners of West Rubedo in celebrating their accomplishments in retaking another floor in the once forsaken mines. The Mayor’s daughter, Adelaide Beryl, personally congratulates the town’s miners.</li>
            <li>As the celebration goes on, Xander wanders around town slightly drunk, and eventually comes across a giant, bipedal rat that greets him in a distinguished voice. He introduces himself as Mammel, and tells Xander that “Adalar Warder would like a drink as well.”</li>
            <li>Almost in disbelief, Xander follows Mammel to the back of the Rubedo guardhouse, where a disheveled and unkempt man with an eyepatch is looking through the small, barred window of a basement cell. Delighted, he requests that Xander share his drink, which he hesitantly passes through the bars.</li>
            <li>Xander makes Adalar and Mammel’s acquaintance, before seeking the rest of the party. They hardly believe his drunken recollection of a rat with a deep voice.</li>
            <li>That night, Syn finds a letter in his room. He opens it to find a missive, a fragrant purple leaf and a piece of a moray mask. He quickly destroys the missive after reading it.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>In the morning, the party gathers for breakfast. They look through the newspaper and the notice board once again. They decide to take on the request to join the miners in clearing out another level of the mines.</li>
            <li>Joining up near one of the entrances to the Rubedan mountain depths, some party members consider the crates of hardhats, before agreeing to wear them just in case. The troupe of miners join up with them soon after, as does Mammel, fully equipped with a pickaxe and his own hardhat. The rest of the party is in disbelief that Xander was telling the truth.</li>
            <li>Separating from the miners and Mammel at a fork, the party ventures into the tunnels, clearing them out of monsters and critters in the dark. Eventually, they reach a corridor with a broken seal, which the miners reinforce as best they can.</li>
            <li>In the mine, Endhal finds a small collection of mining logs. The last pages are brittle and blurred with dried blood. He makes out the name “Dyorind” on it, as well as the year 858.</li>
            <li>Back at the tavern for a quick lunch, the party talks with Alf-Bryndel, and learns a bit more about the orphans of Rubedo.</li>
            <li>That day, while shopping around, Endhal gets caught stealing, and has to run damage control. Meanwhile, Iszyre uses this distraction to steal something himself. Following that, Xander gets Endhal to agree to a contest of sorts, with the loser having to take on the request to tell some stories to the orphans.</li>
            <li>They decide on a game involving chasing Cadenza around town. Despite being the one to instigate, Xander’s team loses.</li>
            <li>During the day, Mammel comes to request another drink for his friend. Xander and Iszyre begrudgingly oblige, and bring the man his tankard of brew. Adalar grins and indulges in the drink. When asked about his crimes, he just tells the two that he is exactly where he wants to be: Just laying low for the time being.</li>
            <li>That evening, Xander takes his place in the chapel and tells the orphans of Rubedo a grandiose tale. Mammel is in attendance.</li>
